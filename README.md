# Handwriting_Recognition_DL

This project is a part of my Deep Learning Course Project. Handwriting recognition using Deep Learning techniques. This is important in the medical field to help pharmacists decode a doctor's messy handwriting and provide the patient with the correct prescription. This model is developed using TensorFlow. The dataset is trained to recognize the handwritten text and digitize it.

Though there exists other methods, one of the most common method for handwritten recognition is the traditional OCR. This is a rule-based system, where the system recognizes two diagonal lines with one horizontal line as 'A'. This does not provide good accuracy since the rules don't hold for different types of handwriting.

Therefore, a deep learning model which uses tensorflow was proposed to try and recognize the handwritten text and digitize it.
